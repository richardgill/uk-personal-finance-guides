# Stocks and Shares ISAs

## Benefits

* ISAs are tax free. Any gains (which compound) are not taxed.
* You can transfer your money out of an ISA at any time and spend it on anything you like. You can have your money within 5 working days.
* Tax is so simple - it doesn't complicate tax return / require accountant assistance.

## Limitations

* Max you can invest is capped at Â£20k per tax year (April to April). This is called your *allowance*.
* If you transfer money out of your ISA account, you cannot get that allowance back.
* You cannot invest in all assets (although indexes are fine). 

## Risks

Government rule changes:

* The amount you can invest per year could be lowered (or raised).
* The government decides to tax people on what's in their ISA already.
