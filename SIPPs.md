# SIPPs (pension)

A SIPP is a private UK pension which has some tax benefits.

## How it works

### Tax relief going in

When you put money into a SIPP if you pay income tax, you can deduct [income tax](https://www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates) entirely from your pension contribution.

Say you put in £1 of your after tax earnings into a SIPP and you pay 40% tax:

```
(£1 + SIPP_RELIEF) * (1 – 0.4) = £1
```

Rearrange it:

```
£1 + SIPP_RELIEF = £1 / (1 – 0.4)

SIPP_RELIEF = (£1 / (1 – 0.4)) - £1

SIPP_RELIEF = £0.66
```

* At 20% tax: every after-tax £ can be multipled by `1.25...`
* At 40% tax: every after-tax £ can be multipled by `1.666666...`
* At 45% tax: every after-tax £ can be multipled by `1.818181...`

### Tax on withdrawl

When you withdraw your pension you can:

* Withdraw 25% of the pension tax-free
* Pay [income tax](https://www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates) on 75% of it.

## Benefits

* The tax relief is large.
* You don't pay any tax on any gains (which compound).

## Limitations

* You cannot access your money until you reach retirement age (55)
* You cannot invest more than £40k a year
* Your tax relief decreases as you put more money into your pension and go through tax bands.
* Limits to which assets you can invest in (but index funds are fine).
* You do pay tax when you withdraw money out of your pension.

## Risks

1. The amount you can invest per year could be lowered (or raised).
2. Retirement age will change, it will likely go up. 
3. Tax relief on the way in could change (this is ok, because you can just stop putting more money into it)
4. Tax exemption of gains could change (this could affect all the money in your pension, which you can't take out!)
5. Tax on withdrawl could (and is likely) to change. So you don't know how much you'll get taxed on withdrawl. 

Things to consider:

* You're irreversibly at risk of government policy for `55 - your_age` years (or longer).
* However politically making large negative changes would be unpopular with voters. 
* Making things worse will increase the burden on the state to stop pensioners falling into poverty. So making it worse might cost government more money in welfare etc.
* `4.` and `5.` will be unpopular with older people - a demographic which typically has strong turn-out in elections.
* The risks are worse if you're young for two reasons: You have longer to endure policy changes. Young people don't vote as much or care about pensions as much.
